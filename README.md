## About

This repo contains source code for a data analysis and web application developed for the [Maine Healthy Beaches (MHB) Program](http://www.mainehealthybeaches.org/).

The purpose of this work was to assist MHB in exploring and understanding the frequency and persistence of bacteria exceedences at Maine Beaches. MHB routinely collects water quality samples of indicator bacteria at beaches along the Maine coast in order to support beach notification programs.

An interactive website was also built using the [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web application framework from RStudio.

The datasets are not included in this repo, and thus the analysis and web application cannot be compiled without permission and access to these datasets.
